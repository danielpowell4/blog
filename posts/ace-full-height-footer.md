In what otherwise an overly engineered site with script-based animation and non-traditional window size blockers, we find this gem of a footer.

Keeping with the rest of the site's one view-height one purpose theme, this footer offers everything one could ask for: a stylized capture email form, a high-level menu, and the "need to have" legal and social icon scrub.

This footer is particularly brilliant, though, because of its superb use of grey and slow-so-you-notice animations on the main menu which load a true white from the bottom.
