CSS Counters are a fantastic way to make ordered lists better.

Check out [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_counters.asp) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters) for a full tutorial.

Otherwise, you declare a counter reset and increment on a before element. The rest is CSS magic
