This is a quick and dirty demo of the checkbox hack strategy for a CSS only hide&show menu.

This avoids the need to include javascript of any sorts and builds out the modern feature set a savvy user expects.

The menu is hidden by default and grows in from the left only when the "button" is clicked.
