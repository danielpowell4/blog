A collection of different hamburger menus. Though they aren't _really_ any better than a 3-element div menu, I think this is a lovely showcase of how CSS pseudo elements can help keep things that are really just styles outside of the DOM.

This also shows how powerful the `position` property can be, though it's a bit lesser used in the fancy world of widely supported `flexbox` and `css-grid` that we now live in (ðŸ‘´ speaks).
