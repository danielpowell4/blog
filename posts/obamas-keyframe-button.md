After 8 years in the White House, it makes sense that Obama wanted to go out in style.

This is a fun button from the new wordpress site, Obama.org. The animation recreated here, which spotted on Jan 30, 2017, uses a simple keyframe rotation to cycle through 4 colors on hover in just under a second flat.
