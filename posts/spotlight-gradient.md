CSS custom properties (variables) has unlocked a world of fun.

This gradient-based spotlight follow cursor on hover, spotted over at [airbnb.com](https://airbnb.com) button only requires a simple `mousemove` event listener to update 2 style properties, mouseX and mouseY--with left/top being 0% and right/bottom being 100%.

CSS does the rest!
