Embodied by Instagram's new logo, linear gradients are certainly topping the moment's trends. The light colors on these 4 text patterns have 23ยบ tilt in line with the earth. On hover they shift not in color but in position. This abrupt animation to the right provides a hint of extra UX toppings to an already crisp coloration.
