This pen showcases menu highlights inspired by a highlighter. The right align gives the menu a tad more of an edge. Through google fonts this pen sports Catamaran.

The juice is towards the bottom of the css in styled :before elements on the links, which transition from `left: 100%` to `left: 10px` or so.
