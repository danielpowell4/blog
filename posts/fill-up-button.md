This button loads in from the bottom using a well-traveled css-based animation of a ::before pseudo element.

This is a bit different than normal in that it plays on a scale3D changing from a resting value of `transform: scale3d(1, 0, 1);` to an active hover value of : `transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);`

First see on Google Home Mini's landing page
