Glitches are back and cool again.

Here is a simple CSS-only animation that you can easily lift and put on your 404 (or home) page.

It uses the css clip attributes on two pseudo elements. Find the colors in glitch:before and :after. The content is passed in through the data-text attr in the html.

Regrettably I can't remember where I first saw this but think that hat tip goes to someone like Digital Ocean or Linode.
