Deals. Cookies. Terms. Every site and app has its constraints.

This example, recreated from [Atomic's website](https://www.atomic.com/), merges the typical "disagree" and "abort" buttons into a slick button that only takes up 1 button unit of pixel space.

A simple hover action over the :pseudo element powered X marks the spot, doubles the thickness creating a clean look to match the clean, trustworthy font (Montserrat).

A 1px transform brings it altogether upon click, which would be handled through async JS in a real in-app implementation.
